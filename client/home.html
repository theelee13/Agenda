			<h3 style="text-align:center">Welcome to Dr. Kennedy's weekly planner!</h3>
			<p>The goal of this project is to consolidate the planning tools and agendas used each semester and eliminate their paper waste! To start, please log in with your own email address. Following login, you may click the 'Schedules' tab to create a new schedule. After completing your first schedule, it will be viewable by clicking on the same tab and then on the name of the schedule. This goes for all future schedules, as well!</p>
			<p>From the selected schedule, you may choose to add activities. These may be extracurricular involvments, academics, or even social outings and sleep! Activities are grouped by color: white, blue, red, green, or yellow. You may choose to associate different activities with different colors, but the default color is white. You may choose, for example, to highlight all sciences with a green. You would then select green for each science class you add to the activity list. These activities belong to you, not the individual schedule. This means you won't need to create each activity every time you start a new week!</p>
